# Linear Regression from Scratch

This repo contains an implementation of linear regression using NumPy.

## Features
- Gradient descent
- Loss curve plotting
- Regression line visualization

## What's inside
- `Linear Regression from Scratch.ipynb` → my notebook with all the code, experiments, and plots.  
- `simplelinearregression.csv` → a tiny dataset (Age vs Premium) that I used for testing.  

## What I did
- Implemented a custom `LinearRegression` class.  
- Trained it using gradient descent.  
- Tracked the loss curve during training.  
- Plotted the regression line on the dataset to see how well it fits.
